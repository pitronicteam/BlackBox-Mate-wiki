# Dec 2021

We are a little busy this month, our main job, betaflight, gyroflow, etc. so we haven't brought too many updates to BBM. But all the updates we bring are really necessary. We'll bring more cool features in 2022!

### Database

* Fix log4j2 bug (Dec 13, 2021)
* Remove temporary files to save disk space (Dec 21, 2021)

{% hint style="info" %}
It seems that with the growth of our users, we need to remove temporary files more often. So, please help collect sponsors from FPV manufacturers. We don't wanna charge users!
