# Why we choose AGPL3.0

**For you reference:**

* betaflight uses GPL-3.0
* INAV uses GPL-3.0
* PIDtoolbox uses GPL-3.0
* OpenTX/EgdeTX uses GPL-2.0

But BBM kernel chooses AGPL-3.0 as our open source license. Why?

In this wiki, we hope that by using plain and easy-to-understand language and logic we can thoroughly explain the structure of BBM's intellectual property rights, and briefly talk about the reasons why we did this.

Firstly, we should start our talk with open-source licenses.
